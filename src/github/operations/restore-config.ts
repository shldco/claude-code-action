//                  Restoring it would also undo the PR checkout entirely.
//   .gitconfig   — git reads ~/.gitconfig and .git/config, never cwd/.gitconfig.
//   .bashrc etc. — shells source these from $HOME; checkout cannot reach $HOME.
//   .vscode/.idea— IDE config; nothing in the CLI's startup path reads them.

/**
 * Restores security-sensitive config paths from the PR base branch.
 *
 * The CLI's non-interactive mode trusts cwd: it reads `.mcp.json`,
 * `.claude/settings.json`, and `.claude/settings.local.json` from the working
 * directory and acts on them before any tool-permission gating — executing
 * hooks (including SessionStart), setting env vars (NODE_OPTIONS, LD_PRELOAD,
 * PATH), running apiKeyHelper/awsAuthRefresh shell commands, and auto-approving
 * MCP servers. When this action checks out a PR head, all of these are
 * attacker-controlled.
 *
 * Rather than enumerate every dangerous key, this replaces the entire `.claude/`
 * tree and `.mcp.json` with the versions from the PR base branch, which a
 * maintainer has reviewed and merged. Paths absent on base are deleted.
 *
 * Known limitation: if a PR legitimately modifies `.claude/` and the CLI later
 * commits with `git add -A`, the revert will be included in that commit. This
 * is a narrow UX tradeoff for closing the RCE surface.
 *
 * @param baseBranch - PR base branch name. Must be pre-validated (branch.ts
 *   calls validateBranchName on it before returning).
